<h1 class="title">Dog-Friendly Hotel in Phitsanulok — A Personal Review (Dec 19, 2025)</h1>
<img src="/img/dog-friendly-hotel-in-phitsanulok.jpg">
<p>I stayed <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/y52oQig4bTLRvKzs7" target="new">here</a> with my wife and our two dogs (8 kg each). The rate was 650 baht per night. There are some dog-friendly hotels on Airbnb, but this hotel is much cheaper.</p>
<p>The front desk staff were very friendly and made us feel at home. And the property is fully enclosed, which almost prevents dogs from outside from entering and makes it a safe place to walk around.</p>
