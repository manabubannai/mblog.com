<h1 class="title">Intuition by OSHO (Book Review) — Why Intuition Matters in the Age of AI</h1>
<img src="/img/intuition-by-osho-book-review.jpg">
<p>I realized how foolish I was. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312275676" target="new">This book</a> made me realize that I had not really seen anything with my own eyes.</p>
<hr>
<p>In this book, the difference between <b>intellect</b>, <b>instinct</b>, and <b>intuition</b> is explained clearly.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intellect</b>: the middle level of knowledge </li>
<li><b>Instinct</b>: the lower level of knowledge </li>
<li><b>Intuition</b>: the higher level of knowledge </li>
</ul>
<p>To look a little deeper:</p>
<ul class="long_list">
<li><b>Intellect</b> functions in the conscious mind. It thinks, analyzes, and explains. It is useful—but it has no wisdom of its own.</li>
<li><b>Instinct</b> comes from the unconscious. It is the intelligence of the body. Animals live by it naturally. It knows when to rest and when to eat. It does not think—it simply knows.</li>
<li><b>Intuition</b> comes from beyond both—the superconscious. It is not of the body, and not of the mind. It gives direction, meaning, and alignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The author emphasizes that <b>intellect has no direction of its own</b>. It is only a servant. It will justify whatever is above it or below it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to go with instinct, intellect will find a way. If you are a religious person and want to go against instinct, intellect will still find a way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intellect should never be the master. When intellect decides everything, life becomes clever but blind. Only intuition can give true direction.</p>
<p>In the age of AI, intellect has become replaceable. That’s why I choose to live by trusting instinct and intuition.</p>
<p>Lastly, here are my notes on what I noticed while reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>For the body</b>: trust instinct and intuition</li>
<li><b>For consumption</b>: instinct and intuition are fine, but let intellect assist. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Below are some other highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you know the truth, enjoy it! What is the point of going around the whole country defeating people? If you know the truth, people will come to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, this is meditation. </p>
<p>For a while, I kept thinking about how I should share my experience of meditation. I didn’t know how to do it, so I stopped.</p>
<p>Later, I realized something simple. Just going with the flow — and living it myself — is already a good beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you want to remair intelligent, you will have to drop imitating,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is okay to imitate parts of others. But imitating everything leads nowhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To die to the past is intelligence, and to live in the present is intelligence.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is when playing with soap bubbles that he has always arrived at certain insights for which he has been thinking and thinking but was failing and failing. It is always in his bathtub that insights flash into his mind. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a story about Albert Einstein.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking can think only about something that is already known. You are lost in a forest, you don&#39;t have any map, there is nobody you can ask. What are you thinking about? But still you think. That thinking will be just a worry, not a thinking. And the more you get worried, the less the inner guide can be competent.</p>
